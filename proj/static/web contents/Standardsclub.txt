 As a mark of our belief and effort to imparting quality education to our students, Stella Maris College has partnered with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) through the setting up of the Standards Club. The Standards Club, an initiative of the BIS is a step towards amassing the power of youth towards spreading awareness on the importance of quality standards.
 Governmental partnerships with academic institutions provide substantial benefits for the community. The urge for quality that stems from better awareness will pave way for quality goods and services that are reliable, safe and sustainable. A partnership of this kind is significant to expose students to industry level conformity assessments and basis of quality certifications for goods and services. The Standards club of Stella Maris College was inaugurated on the 10th of August 2022 in the presence of BIS officials, faculty and students. Presently the club has 104 student members who will be carriers of the message to the community. As
 recognition for their enthusiastic participation and encouragement, student members were provided with badges.
