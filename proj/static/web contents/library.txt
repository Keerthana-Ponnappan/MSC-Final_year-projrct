 ID's, breeze past the several reference books to reach the computer section to find the books, journals, research papers through online catalogue such as OPAC - as if it is the most natural thing to do.

 Stella Maris College Library was started in the present campus in 1962, which was initially in a room (M-01) of the main building with book racks on one side and a counter on the other side. Seven years after its humble beginning, Sr. Maryji was given charge of the library. The impressive double storied building which hosts the library was the result of her vision. The fruit of five years of studying other reputed libraries, the present building was inaugurated in 1975 when Sr. Irene Mathias was the principal of the college. When the government mandated all colleges to have
 a Librarian with a master's degree in Library Science, Ms. Gita Balachandran became the Librarian of Stella Maris College in 1978. The library has evolved over the years in so many ways, it has become much more user friendly, yet it manages to maintain the charm of the good old days. The Stella Maris College Library is a pioneer in several ways - automation of the entire library was done as early as 2003. It was the first to introduce bar coding among the city colleges. The Madras University Library followed suit later. Today one enters the library, scan the
 ID's, breeze past the several reference books to reach the computer section to find the books, journals, research papers through online catalogue such as OPAC - as if it is the most natural thing to do. Browsing through racks and racks of books seems rather tedious, when one can find all that they need at just the click of a mouse. That is how much the library has changed. The postgraduate library has a whole gamut of resources-books, journals, doctoral theses of the students and faculty. It has been revamped with new modular research cubicles equipped with computers and has
