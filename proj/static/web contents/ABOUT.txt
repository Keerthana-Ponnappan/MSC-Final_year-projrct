 The Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) of the College was set up as a part of the post-accreditation Quality Sustenance Activities recommended by the National Accreditation Assessment Council (NAAC) in order to enhance quality in a continuous process for academic and administrative excellence. The IQAC functions as a core quality enhancing system, facilitating a sense of belonging through a participatory approach towards enhancing, sustaining and internalising quality culture within the institution. The IQAC is made up of a team, headed by the Principal.
 The activities of the IQAC unit focus on Quality enhancement, the internalisation of quality culture, and the setting up of mechanisms and procedures to ensure the prompt and efficient performance of academic, administrative and financial tasks. Training programmes are organised periodically for the faculty, the administrative and support staff and the students. The IQAC also endeavours to optimise the integration of modern methods of teaching, learning and evaluation and ensures the adequacy, maintenance and functioning of the support structure.
 The IQAC organises workshops / seminars on quality related themes and also prepares the Annual Quality Assurance Report (AQAR) of the College.
