 SAMUDRA is a bi-annual, fully open-sourced online double-blind peer reviewed multidisciplinary journal of Humanities, Social Sciences and Commerce. It promotes a multifaceted approach rather than a rigid discipline-centric one and encourages empirically, theoretically and analytically grounded articles related to any area of study under the umbrella term of Humanities, Social Sciences and Commerce: namely Economics, Commerce & Business Studies, Literary & Cultural Studies, Visual Arts, Sociology, History, Social Work, Political Science and International Relations. The multidisciplinary nature of the journal allows for an issue/theme to be viewed from the various standpoints afforded by the different disciplines. It aims at providing
 a space for the free flow of fresh perspectives between these disciplines.
 The journal is premised on the assumption that a holistic understanding of social, cultural, political and aesthetic issues is possible only using a multidisciplinary perspective. To this end, each issue of the journal will deal with a specific theme that will be addressed from the standpoint of the disciplines that fall under the rubric of Humanities, Social Sciences and commerce.
