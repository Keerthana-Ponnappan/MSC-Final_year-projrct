 The Centre for Research in Science and Technology (CRIST) was inaugurated on November 4, 2010 with the objective of promoting scientific research especially in the fields of Biotechnology, Microbiology and Physical sciences involving the department of Physics, Chemistry ,Botany, Zoology, Biotechnology and bioinformatics. The activities of the CRIST lab are supervised by Dr. Mary N.L the Administrative Director.
 The centre is equipped with the following instruments: FT-IR Spectrometer, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Millipore Water Purifier, Trinocular-Phase Contrast Microscope and CO2 Incubator ,UV-visible spectrophotometer, Centrifuge, laminar flow, Biochemical Analyser etc.
 The centre provides instrumental facilities for the students of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics for their UG and PG projects. The center has provision for animal & human cell cultures and extends the research facility to students and researchers of other colleges in antibacterial, antioxidant & cytotoxic effects.
